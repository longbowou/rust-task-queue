# Rust Task Queue - Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the rust-task-queue crate, organized by priority and implementation
phases.

## Completed Features (v0.1.x)

### Core Task Queue System

- **Redis-backed broker** with connection pooling
- **Auto-scaling workers** based on queue load with intelligent metrics
- **Task scheduling** with delay support and persistent storage
- **Multiple queue priorities** (default, high, low)
- **Retry logic** with configurable attempts and backoff
- **Task timeouts** and failure handling
- **Comprehensive metrics** collection and reporting
- **Graceful shutdown** with configurable timeouts
- **Task registry** with type-erased executors

### Observability & Monitoring

- **Structured logging** with tracing integration
- **Performance metrics** with SLA monitoring
- **Health checks** with component status
- **Memory monitoring** and leak detection
- **Alert system** for performance violations
- **Comprehensive diagnostics** endpoints

### Web Framework Integration

- **Actix Web integration** with complete feature parity
    - All metrics endpoints with JSON responses
    - Health checks and system status
    - Auto-route configuration
    - Helper functions and macros
- **Axum integration** with complete feature parity
    - All metrics endpoints with JSON responses
    - Health checks and system status
    - Auto-route configuration
    - Helper functions and macros

### Configuration & Management

- **Configuration management** (TOML, YAML, ENV)
- **Auto-registration** with inventory-based discovery
- **CLI support** with worker binaries
- **Docker support** with multi-stage builds

### Testing & Quality

- **Comprehensive test suite** (220 tests across 6 categories)
- **Integration tests** with Redis containers
- **Performance benchmarks** with regression tracking
- **Security tests** for input validation
- **Error scenario tests** for edge cases
- **Automated testing scripts** with cleanup

## Future Considerations

### Enhance Integrations

- **Additional web frameworks**
    - [ ] **Warp integration** - Lightweight framework support
    - [ ] **Rocket integration** - Type-safe framework support
    - [ ] **Salvo integration** - Modern async framework

### Performance Optimizations

- **Batch processing** for high-throughput scenarios
- **Memory optimization** for large task payloads
- **Connection pooling** improvements
- **Serialization optimization** with custom protocols

### Advanced Scheduling

- **Cron expressions** for recurring tasks
- **Calendar-based scheduling** with timezone support
- **Task dependencies** and workflow orchestration
- **Conditional execution** based on external state

### Advanced Monitoring

- **Prometheus metrics** export
- **Grafana dashboards** for visualization
- **OpenTelemetry integration** for distributed tracing
- **Custom metrics plugins** for domain-specific monitoring

## Advanced Auto Scaling

- **Currently**: Multi-dimensional metrics and adaptive thresholds
- **Medium-term**: Task complexity awareness and priority-based scaling
- **Long-term**: Predictive scaling and cost optimization
- **Advanced**: Machine learning integration

### Distributed Features

- **Redis Cluster support** for high availability
- **Cross-datacenter replication** for disaster recovery
- **Distributed task routing** based on worker capabilities
- **Global load balancing** across multiple instances

### Testing Strategy

- **Stress tests** for different load patterns (burst, sustained, gradual)
- **Chaos engineering tests** for scaling under failures
- **Performance regression tests** for scaling decision latency

### Storage Backends

- **PostgreSQL backend** for ACID compliance
- **MongoDB backend** for document-based tasks
- **In-memory backend** for development/testing
- **Hybrid backends** for different task types

## Release Schedule

### v0.1.4 (Current)

- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- Performance optimizations

## Contributing
