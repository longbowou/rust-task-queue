## What's Next?

Short-term (Week 2-3)
Implement async task timeouts
Add distributed tracing
Create comprehensive benchmarks

Medium-term (Month 1)
Build plugin system architecture
Add rate limiting and auth
Implement chaos engineering tests

Long-term (Month 2+)
Performance optimization based on metrics
Advanced auto-scaling algorithms
Multi-region deployment support

- Distributed Mode: Multi-Redis support
- Web UI: Task monitoring dashboard
- Dead Letter Queues: Failed task handling
- Task Dependencies: Workflow support
- Metrics Export: Prometheus integration
- Security: Authentication & authorization

High Priority (Immediate Impact)
Enhanced input validation and security audit logging
Memory management improvements and compression
Better error recovery with circuit breakers
Connection pool warming and health monitoring

Medium Priority (Strategic Improvements)
Task priorities and SLA management
Advanced monitoring and observability
Configuration hot reloading
Multi-tenancy support

Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
Plugin system architecture
Task dependencies and workflows
Task streaming and real-time updates
Chaos engineering test framework

## Auto Scaling

Implementation Priority
Phase 1 (Immediate): Multi-dimensional metrics and adaptive thresholds
Phase 2 (Medium-term): Task complexity awareness and priority-based scaling
Phase 3 (Long-term): Predictive scaling and cost optimization
Phase 4 (Advanced): Machine learning integration

Testing Strategy
Enhance the existing comprehensive test suite with:
Stress tests for different load patterns (burst, sustained, gradual)
Chaos engineering tests for scaling under failures
Performance regression tests for scaling decision latency
Cost optimization simulations
Multi-queue priority scenarios
