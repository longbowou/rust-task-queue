## What's Next?

Short-term (Week 2-3)
Implement async task timeouts
Add distributed tracing
Create comprehensive benchmarks

Medium-term (Month 1)
Build plugin system architecture
Add rate limiting and auth
Implement chaos engineering tests

Long-term (Month 2+)
Performance optimization based on metrics
Advanced auto-scaling algorithms
Multi-region deployment support

- Distributed Mode: Multi-Redis support
- Web UI: Task monitoring dashboard
- More Integrations: Axum, Warp, etc.
- Batch Processing: Bulk task operations
- Dead Letter Queues: Failed task handling
- Task Dependencies: Workflow support
- Metrics Export: Prometheus integration
- Security: Authentication & authorization

## Auto Scaling

Implementation Priority
Phase 1 (Immediate): Multi-dimensional metrics and adaptive thresholds
Phase 2 (Medium-term): Task complexity awareness and priority-based scaling
Phase 3 (Long-term): Predictive scaling and cost optimization
Phase 4 (Advanced): Machine learning integration

Testing Strategy
Enhance the existing comprehensive test suite with:
Stress tests for different load patterns (burst, sustained, gradual)
Chaos engineering tests for scaling under failures
Performance regression tests for scaling decision latency
Cost optimization simulations
Multi-queue priority scenarios
